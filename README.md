Open Stand Kit is a project aim to provide a design of foldable portable standing desk / laptop stand by cardboard. It could be made by using scissors, tape and stapler. Therefore, everyone is able to clone and customize its size according to their height and usage.

The design is inspired by a Kickstarter project, Levit8 , flat folding portable standing desk. It is based on an origami folding technique called “Box-Spiral folding technique” (Available in the book - “Folding Techniques for Designer” by Paul Jackson). The same technique also be used in a chair called Kada Stool from fuseproject.

This project offers the design file for laser cutting machine and building instruction for users to get started. Since the kit is just formed by 8 pieces of triangle shape cardboard. Laser cutter is not really a must. You may  cut cardboard into the required shape manually.

However, if you are lazy to make / not feel comfortable to place your laptop on handicraft. I would suggest purchasing a Levit8 directly.
